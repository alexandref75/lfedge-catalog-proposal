# LFEdge Catalog Proposal

Catalog of LFedge demos and stacks.

Original idea documented [on LFEdge wiki](https://wiki.lfedge.org/display/LE/LF+Edge+Catalog)

_NOTE: This is a work in progress_

## Tutorials

We are currently exploring two different modes of deployment, helm charts for kubernetes based deployments and docker-compose for container based deployments

### Kubernetes (helm charts)

- [Setting up a test cluster with k3d](https://k3d.io)
- [Using helm tutorial](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)
- A hello world helm chart (TBD)
  - extending with custom content (TBD)
  - extending with daemonsets (TBD)
  - extending to show dependencies (TBD)
  - extending to show multi-app stack (TBD)
  - [Helm Template Tutorial](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/)
- Publishing helm charts (TBD)
  - to a web page
  - to a OCI registry
  - with GitHub actions
- Useful tools
  - [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io)
  - [Kubernetes Lens](https://k8slens.dev/)
  - [Portainer](https://portainer.io/)

### Docker (compose)
